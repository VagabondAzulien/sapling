# Contributing to Sapling

If you actually want to contribute to this software, first off: Thanks! Sapling
is just a side-project, unintended for any significant use.

Sapling is written in Ruby, and adheres to the standard Rubocop rules. So long
as your code passes those rules, it should be good. At time of writing, Sapling
has no testing, because I honestly have very little experience writing tests.
Hopefully this changes soon!

If you don't know how to program in Ruby, but wish to improve this software,
feel free to submit an issue or reach out to me directly.

Thanks again for your interest in Sapling!
