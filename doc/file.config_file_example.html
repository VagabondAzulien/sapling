  trunk: &quot;This is a general introduction to the dialogue tree.&quot;

# Branches are the content of a dialogue tree. Each branch is numbered, and that
# number is used as the primary means of navigation. The text of a branch is the
# story provided to the user; the result of getting to the branch. The leaves
# (the section titled leaf) represent the options. Options are displayed in the
# order they appear. Within a leaf, the text is what the option says, and the
# branch is the branch number which this option will lead to. Leading to branch
# number 0 will immediately exit the program.
#
# You can have as many branches and leaves as you wish, though having too many
# leaves may lead to both display problems, and paralyzing indecision.
-
  branch:
    number: 1
    text: &quot;The first branch. Displayed first, by default.&quot;
    leaf:
      -
        text: &quot;The first option for this branch. It leads to branch 2&quot;
        branch: 2
      -
        text: &quot;The second branch. It immediately exits the program.&quot;
        branch: 0

# A terminal branch is a branch which has no leaves. This represents an ending.
# Once a user hits a terminal branch, the program will display the branch text,
# and then redirect the user to branch 0, to exit.
-
  branch:
    number: 2
    text: &quot;This is a terminal branch. After displaying this text,
      the program will exit.&quot;
